# Financial-Analytics-using-Python-PKDD99-Challenge-
This Project is Developed in Python on a Financial Dataset which aims at Creating a Datamart for all the Clients of the bank which includes details about their Past Transactions, Demographics, Credit Card Activities and much more.


➢ This Project is to create a base table for the PKDD'99 Discovery Challenge and do Visualization and Descriptive Analyses on the Datamart

➢ Basically, the bank wants to improve the Services and distinguish more closely on who is a good client (to offer additional services) & who is a bad client (whom to watch carefully to minimize the bank loses).

➢ The bank has provided data about their clients, the accounts (transactions within several months), the loans already granted, the credit cards issued. The below Base table will help bank managers improve their understanding of customers and seek specific actions to improve services.


➢ Final Client Bastable: Client Characteristics which includes 1 row per Client
